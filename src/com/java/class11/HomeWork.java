    // Homework switch statements

    // 1. Write a program that takes a day of the week as input (e.g., “Monday”), and outputs the number of days
    // until the next weekend (i.e., either Saturday or Sunday). Use a switch statement to implement this program.

    // Sample outputs for input "Monday" would be "5" and input "Friday" would be "2"

    // 2. Write a program that takes an operator (e.g., “+”, “-”, “*”, “/”) and two integers as input, and outputs
    // the result of the operation. Use a switch statement to implement this program. Make sure to consider
    // the possibility of division by zero, and any other edge cases.

    // Sample outputs for input "+ 2 3" would be "5", input "/ 6 2" would be "3", input "* 7 8" would be "56",
    // if we have edge case input "/ 5 0" would be "division by zero is not allowed" or similar message
